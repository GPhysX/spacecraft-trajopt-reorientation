# spacecraft-trajopt-reorientation
Optimal spacecraft reorientation due to momentum exchange using point internal masses in 2D

Using CasADi's NLP interface and the IPOPT optimizer, I solved optimal trajectories for min time and min energy objectives for circular, square, rectangular, and bowtie spacecraft shapes. Trapezoidal time discretization was applied.
